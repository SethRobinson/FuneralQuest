Pale Horse Cafe

The Pale Horse has been here since you can remember.  A great place to gossip

You sit down at one of the large oak tables.

The Reaper Club

You shiver as you approach The Reaper, a rave club
frequented by the underbelly of society. (mostly
funeral directors)

Just think of the beautiful memory picture you would have of your mother in a Gold casket...

I can tell by the fine suit you're wearing that you appreciate the finer things.

I don't mean to rush you, but this isn't really something you can wait a week thinking about..

Well, I suppose you COULD go with the cheaper casket.. except it really doesn't offer much protection
from worms and the like.

You know.. your fathers social security death benefits would probably cover some...

Ma'am,  let me ask you one simple thing.  Did you hate him?  Why else wouldn't you make this funeral
something to be proud of?

A gold casket reflects character and station in life.. it's suberb styling reflects a successful living.

You know, I saw your neighbor in today.. he bought a gold casket.  Impeccable taste, that man has.

Embalming is uh, required by the state for uh, disease reasons.  Yeah, required. 

The funeral is not occasion for a display of cheapness, you know.

I would stay away from cremation.  Your loved one deserves better than 'bake and shake'!

you see a random message:

1.  "Time passes slowly.  Your door remains unshadowed."
2.  "You wait for a while.  Nothing happens."
3.  "You stare at the door as if commanding it to open.  It doesn't."

Created a random customer using adlib type stuff starting with 1of 6 general designs.

Pattern 1:

A %person enters the shop.  %his/her eyes are red and puffy, obviously from weeping.  

"My %deadperson was %1 by a %2 in a terrible accident.  I require a %3 casket and a plot.  Can you
do it?"

%person can be: young woman, old lady, young man, very old man, beautiful woman, really ugly chick

%his/her is modified to match the customers sex

%deadperson can be son, daughter, father, cousin, twin brother, twin sister, uncle, neice, 
    mother or husband/wife depending on customers sex.

%1 could be:  hit, smashed, run over, thrown, crushed, had a nasty incident with

%2 could be:  car, tractor, fridge, piano, bull, elephant, truck, fork-lift, workout machine

%3 could be Wooden, fancy wooden, silver or gold casket.

In this case, if you don't have the right casket or a plot free, she will walk.

Pattern 2:



Quotes:

"No sweetie, it really is spelled 'button'" - Seth

"Hayai kudasai!!!" (tranlated: hurry please!) - Seth as he claps his hands in an
 annoying fasion

"My president sucks ass" - Akiko

 
"Don't pick your ear with the stylus!" - Seth
"Why?" - Akiko
