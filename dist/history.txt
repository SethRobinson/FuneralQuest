** Known bugs/issues **


** what's new in 0.99 **

* $ symbol is now stripped from player names
* added /tv (on/off) control to chat (Jaylou)
* Can set or disable name changing in the game options (File Sponge)
* Fixed get crazy amount of exp bug with an ill-formed daily event

** what's new in 0.98 **

2-10-2008

* Limit of script variable/function names raised to 64 chars from 32 to fix problems with some FQ addons that went over the limit (Thanks Doug)

** what's new in 0.97 **
        
4-20-2007

* Fixed vuneralibility that would let a hacked client win battles ( reported by Ivan256 )
* Added some security checks, admins, check your error log for messages like:
"Looks like (the player's name) tried to cheat by calling command_battle_run (or another command) with a hacked client".  If you see it,
 I would suggest banning that player, he's sending bad data and probably trying to find an exploit.  Several places are checked
 and I will be adding more.
* Had to redo the installer with NSIS, the old Wise setup wouldn't work, good riddance.  But please let me know if anything is broken...

8-2-2006

* FQLicense server now can properly list two or more games running from the same IP.  Note that different
logon licenses must be used for each one.
* Added "use www.myipaddress.com to be sure of your IP" message

12-21-2005

* Checks and fixes corrupt values for transportation (instead of crashing)
* Sets anyone with negative bury points to 0


(8-26-2004)

* Did some early stress tests with FQStress, (it's still very basic and can't logon yet)
  the MFC based logger is a definite problem, while pounding the server with hundreds
  of requests I'm unable to open a the server configuration window or otherwise do 
  anything through its GUI

* Rewrote the logger to use an STL deque of strings and limit visual updates to every
  half a second, it now functions fine during the stress tests.

(8-24-2004)

* Recompiled with updated support libraries, scripting engine
* Added "Allow X amount of players on at once" setting (Server setup screen) in case due
  to hardware limitations you want to allow less players on at once than your license allows
- Looked for memory/crash type bugs, not able to find them.  But the server is crashing on
  a site when 40+ people are logged on at once so it must be my fault.
- Partially done constucting FQStress, a utility designed to help me stress test the server.
- Is the crash related to saving the player data?  I setup a test that saves 10 times a second
  but was unable to reproduce any problems.

** what's new in 0.95 **

* Fixed issue with maint_player.c not being able to access player vars correctly
* Added new scripting hook newday_player.c, it runs right after the initial logon
  maint for each player.  (or if they stay on past midnight it will get run then too)
  This finally allows mods to change turns and things every day.
* Added modulus (%) op to the scripting language at Joe Johnston's request, special thanks
  to Joe also for noticing all the scripting errors and helping me fix them.
* Added command "Random" to FQscript.  It already had RandomRange(min,max) but Random(max) is just
  something every language should have.
* Replaced my crap FQ scripting documentation with Joe Johnston's version that he was nice enough to donate
* Added relevant links to the FQ Admin help page
* Many misc supporting libraries that FQ uses have been updated for speed and bugfixes
* IP Address shown at the beginning is now correct even on systems with multiple IP's
* Default screen size for the server dialog is slightly bigger now, shows more log
* I now show a "type this from the browser" address to help new admins understand what
  to give to people to play.

No changes to flash were or scripts were made, other than adding newday_player.c which isn't really used.

** what's new in 0.94 **

* Fixed a vulnerability that could cause a crash if a certain kind of malicious packet was sent


** what's new in 0.93 **

* Ok, when I fixed that last crash bug I created another one.  Fixed "Socket Sink" errors.
* Text for entering/leaving the cafe is now colored purple so people can't fake it.
* Added /info command in cafe
* Added /give command in cafe
* Added limit to how many tags a person can receieve by /give per day.  Set default to 1.
* Tags per day now shown on the 'server settings' html
* Server settings now will warn people it's a demo server if applicable
* Enemy hitpoints are now shown before attacking when you break into a parlor.  This
  way people can figure out when stealing is a good idea.  With lockpicks gettings wasted
  now this is important.

//Script related
* maint_player.c is now run for EACH player right after maint each day.  This
  is where you can do things like "if he owns this item, give him this much bonus"
  or whatever.
* Finally added some SCRIPTING DOCUMENTATION!  I have some general info
  and I detail (somewhat) each script command.  You can find Scripting.htm in
  your FQ folder on your start menu.
* New script commands added:
 GetTransportationFromID()
 GetTotalBPs()
 ModTotalBPs();
 GetTodaysBPs();
 ModTodaysBPs();
 GetLuck();
 ModLuck();
 GetTurns();
 ModTurns();
 GetStrength();
 ModStrength();
 GetMaxHP();
 ModMaxHP();
 GetPsychUpgrades();
 ModPsychUpgrades();
 GetPolice();
 SetPolice();
 GetPlayerFights();
 ModPlayerFights();
 GetRankPercent();
 GetTopPlayerID();
 GetRandomPlayerID();
 GetDay();
 GetTourneyDaysLeft();
 AddUpdateBPs();
 AddUpdateTurns();
 AddUpdateLuck();


** what's new in 0.92 **

* Fixed another crash bug, this is the main reason for this release.  It's been tested about
two weeks and has not had a single crash/problem so I believe it is very stable.
* Adjusted luck events a bit and added one text, it's a little easier to raise luck.
* If you want a tournament to automatically start at midnight, you can set the day to -1 to do
  so.  If a tournament has just ended, you don't need to worry about it because it will auto
  reset at midnight.  The -1 trick has one problem, if you restart the server it will change it
  to day 1 and you'll have to set it to -1 again though...

** what's new in 0.91 **

* Hard selling when out of hard sell items no longer causes a crash
* Added some more hard sell item texts, just for fun
* Fixed crash bug with the new color code stripper I added last version
* Fixed bug in my RandomRange() function that could include a # 1 higher
  than the max.  Argh, it was so rare and could possibly screw up so many
  things, this was a nasty ass bug.

** what's new in 0.90 **

* Added a powerful C style scripting engine!  The church is now completely run by script.

The scripting systems primary purpose is to make FQ additions easier, faster and less error prone
to implement.  It also has the tasty side effect of letting anybody who wants to dynamically change game
text and logic do so in a way they could not before.  In fact, someone could now add any number of new buildings
to the FQ map without my help, each with real unique purposes and game logic associated.

To see what a script looks like, edit arson.c in script\events.
* Added the arson event, you can pay gold to set other parlors on fire.  Everything including emailing
  the target player, adding to the log and changing their stats is done by the arson.c script!
* Sifted through and added jjohn's new texts.  Fantastic writing.  I fixed a few typos and cut out any
  events that would conflict with my new hard coded story line plans.  I also changed a lot of #'s to
  balance better with the overall game changes, such as limiting soft sell amounts to multiples of 50.
* Random events now properly format negative #'s for display, rather than "you get -40", you now "lose 40".
(there is a slight issue with the formatting if you GIVE them one thing and REMOVE another thing in the
same event, so don't do it)
* Fixed a small issue where it did not appear to reconnect to the server after making changes in the game config
* It now shows a "Connecting to server" message while waiting for the initial server info.
* The "Bereave Emotion System" was modified, you no longer lose customers for going over their
  limit if they are not pissed in some cases.  (basically, cheapness is no longer
  taken into account when computing if they would leave or not, only emotion. This way it should
  make more sense to the player)
* A new psyche skill is now possible after 5 upgrades, it will double the person's spending limit.
* Now all customers who leave pissed will hit a competing parlor, before it only did it when you
  pissed someone off with sympathy/guilt skills.
* Added a robots.txt file to tell spidering robots not to mess with the server
* Added new items to the store!  Safe, Heavy Padlock and lockpicks. They also show up
  on the stats screen.  (stats.c in  the scripts dir btw)
* Setting the game to day 0 will effectively pause the game until midnight.  Used so you
  start a game perfectly at midnight so all players will start on even ground.
* Fixed a bug where the you could see the hearses for sale listed twice or more.
* "Inactivity timeout" is now active in the chatroom too. Previously, players could
   idle in there all day.
* Slight addition to the html help
* The psychology skill was rebalanced a bit, now each upgrade gives a clear message on the
  new skill you learned.  It's a bit more powerful and noticable now.
* Changed the way the status update timer worked, I believe this fixes a server crash
  bug due to a concurrency issue.
* Text-to-speech from the chatroom sounds better (server side only)
* Server player editor now does case insensitive sorts
* Fixed a bug where sometimes after editing a player the player #id showed wrong after the
  edit
* Padlocks decay and break
* It now shows your correct IP address at startup even on computers with multiple NIC's

** what's new in 0.79 **

* Flash was modified to run a little faster.  Some of the hokey zooming effects were
  removed, it's just too slow.
* Added a few words to badwords.txt
* Luck events no longer take turns
* Luck events and normal events now have separate odds settings on the game settings
  page.  Previously, normal events were hardcoded at 20%.  Upgrading will set
  both to 0.08 which seems about right.  (so, 0.16 chance of one of them total)
* When "best seller of the universe" award is written to deeds.txt it appends
  a linefeed between entries now.
* Added to options to the bank: "All to wood" and "All to gold" since that's all
  people really want to do anyway.
* Fixed huge problem where a game that was "auto reset" after a tournament would stop
  polling for timeouts and updating things causing people to "never log off" which would
  effectively ruin the first day of the tournament.
* I licensed some new intro music for the title screen, I think it sets the mood much better.
* Servers now send a "i'm alive" message to the main license server every 15 minutes,  if
  the license server doesn't receive a message within 20 minutes it will get delisted from
  our server list. (this is only applicable if you have 'advertising' turned on which the
  majority of licensed servers actually don't)
* Fixed problem where Yang's option 1 didn't always work and could cause a client flash hang. (thanks
  mimifish)
* If you change the server port address it now warns you that a restart is required to have it
  take effect.

** what's new in 0.78 **

* Now compatible with Flash 6.  The GET command in Flash 6 is sending a & where it used
  to send a ? - the FQ .exe was modified to accept both types.
* The delay between reconnects to the Auth server is now 30 seconds instead of 15. 
* FQ will now not load if another instance of FQ is already running.  This was added
  at the request of systems that run FQ remotely and sometimes had more than one
  instance going accidently, which caused a lot of problems. 

** what's new in 0.77 **

* If a player crashes while dealing with a customer he will still get credit
  for the sale, he'll be mailed about it.  (idea from Mimifish)
* Battle BP awards are now figured on a curve, more BP gets a lower
  percent so we don't have such outrageous BP's per day.
* Chances of missing and soul striking are now lower.
* Tournament mode finished, will not announce messages during the last
  5 days of the tournament in the log and automatically reset the day
  after the winner is declared at midnight.  
* The game reset option no longer changes all settings back to default
* Added "Library" to Spirit University
* Added new "generic text viewer thing" in the flash, will make stuff
  easier for me
* Added "Book of Deeds" to library (text is stored in deeds.txt in the main
  FQ dir, not stored in DATA because it should stay even after a reset)
* Added ability to see old news in the library
* Added TTS (text to speech) support so FQ could announce
  logons by name.  Can also repeat chat.  This is really just
  a fun thing I've been wanting to play with, no real use.. :)

  (this requires that Microsoft's SAPI 5.1 is installed, if it
  isn't, FQ will still run but won't talk)
* Adjusted the prices of transportation a bit, I'll probably allow this to
  be editted by text file, internally it's setup for it but just have not
  set up the file yet.
* Attackers now have a slight advantage as far as Soul smashes and missing
  goes.

The tournament options are not tested that well, you better watch them
closely, especially the "automatic reset" at midnight. 

** what's new in 0.76 **

* Getting within 50 bucks of a customers limit now gives you the
  extra 10 BP, before it was only giving the within 100 limit.. whups
* Players can now pay 1 gold to change their handle.  (the new option
  is on the stat/inventory screen) - No flash was modified so the
  0.75 flash source is still accurate.
* You can no longer enter accented characters for your name, it was
  throwing off the rankings.
* Color codes can no longer be used in public announcements, it
  was only a matter of time before somebody figured out how to fake
  news items using it...  
* Adjusted the values of the soft sell items a bit, it was
  too easy.

** what's new in 0.75 **

* A crash bug was fixed, this also may have caused people to sometimes lose
  sales.
* News was split up into two sections, people that don't want to see all
  the attack messages now don't have too.
* You can no longer get "wasted turns".  This was here originally
  because I was going to have kind of a popularity meter that
  caused less wasted turns but I've changed the design, so now
  it was just frusterating, so it's gone.
* The daily log can now format URL's, just enter them in brackets
  like this: [www.rtsoft.com] and it will color and make them clickable.
  It does add http:// to keep people from doing file:// type of 
  hijinx and won't crash on nested brackets, etc.
* Right-Click banning now works on off-line players	 (thanks WC)
* Right-Click kicking now works from the choose player to edit menu
* Help pages shouldn't prompt you to download Japanese char sets anymore..
* Soft sell values are now in multiples of 50, a few more lower item
  soft sells are now available
* Signup screen graphics were updated a tad
* Added "Server Settings" to main menu, this way players can check out the
  settings to see if they want to play rather than wasting a player
  slot
* Help & Info, Server Settings and Player Rankings buttons now show
  up right away when starting FQ, this way they can read about the game
  even if there are technical problems. (like playing from AOL)
* I'm now converting %5C to /, there seems to be a browser/flash version that
  is sending %5C's instead of /'s sometimes, seems pretty rare but
  if it helps support another platform...
* Inventory screen now shows ranking #.
* Html player ranking now shows #.  So people can say "I'm in 87th place"
  easier.
* Hard and soft sell text is now editable in hard_sell.txt and soft_sell.txt
* Added about 20 new texts to soft sell, rebalanced.  (thanks Foxxie)
* When "visiting" another player it will show what his transportation is.
* After battle "quotes" are now also sent to the other player involved, to be sure
  he won't miss a choice insult (in addition to the newspaper, crime section)
* If you get within 50, you get a +10 bonus in addition to the great trade bonus
  specified in the config.
* Fixed a small bug where an "over the limit" hard sell wouldn't
  make a customer more mad, now it does, just like soft sell
* Instead of just "on now" you will see a much more descriptive text on the server
  console and with the /all command from the cafe
* You can set the admin email address on the game config screen, this will
  show up on the Server Settings html to players.


** what's new in 0.73 **

* Minimizing now sends the server to the tray.  Right click will brink up a
  quick menu, left click will bring the server back.
* Bank flash graphics updated
* Bank input box defaults to show how many tags you can trade
* Police protected can now be editted in player editor
* You can type :) and ;) in battle messages now (it was stripping
  too much)
* Bank now always shows correct number of tags

* Starting HP and strength can now be set in editor.
* You can no longer hit for "0" hp.
* You can now click the collumns in the player editor to sort by name, id or
  IP address.  (good for finding dupe accounts!)
* Removed auto center code for the custom server message - this way you can
  add color or hitlinks and just add spaces in the beginning yourself if
  you want it centered.
* Pressing ENTER from the main screen will no longer just kill the server
* If you kick someone while he's chatting he will now be shown an error
  message rather than continuing to hammer the server with junk requests.
* The graveyard button was removed until I have a use for it (no more
  error messages will show up in the log from clicking it)
* Added some new music and sound effects to visit competition, hospital.
* Added general store, you can buy hearses.
* Psych upgrades can now be changed in the player editor, was broken before
* Psych abilities have been expanded, up to 5 psych things can happen
  depending on level.
* Attacking BP awards were doubled from the last update, should be about right now.
* Lucky Sparrow's show senders name
* Fixed bug where new users were not being counted as "logons per day".
* When a new user creates an account a the logon noise is played now too.

* Added church (skeleton of it, anyway)
* New user sequence was cleaned up a litte
* Top three players of the day get bonuses now (1/2 and 1/4 for 2nd and 3rd)
* Server updates game info with RTsoft after maint, "days left" won't be
  wrong anymore on the RTsoft server list
* Server can now automatically handle things if the license server is physically
  moved without rebooting.  (It will re-query rtsoft for it's location on every
