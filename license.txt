Why this bsd style license and not GPL or zlib?

Here is the reasoning:

A GPL/LGPL license removes the ability to protect and hide your private code and introduces various licensing limitations concerning proprietary code that are not helpful especially on mobile platforms.

If this was zlib free, someone might eventually GPL a branch and start adding features to it, which could not be shared with the main distribution which has a much more open license. (This happened with my zlib licensed game Dink Smallwood - I was unable to use community improvements from a GPLed version when doing the mobile port, for instance)
